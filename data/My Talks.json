  {"id":"hajovskyCognitiveAssessmentEvaluation2021","abstract":"Cognitive ability tests are often included in diagnostic psychological assessments in school settings for the evaluation of\nspecific learning disabilities (Benson et al., 2019). This session will involve a discussion of recent developments of the theory\nand practice of cognitive assessment, and the interpretative flexibility afforded by different instruments. We demonstrate the\nvalue-added benefit of using cognitive assessment judiciously to make valid decisions to inform placement and treatment. Learning Objectives:\n1. Participants will understand recent developments in CHC theory and how it applies to assessment and interpretation\n2. Participants will learn about the interpretative flexibility afforded by the three most popular IQ tests (WISC-V, KABCII NU, WJ IV)\n3. Participants will examine how cognitive assessment results can clarify identification and treatment outcomes using a\ncase example","author":[{"family":"Hajovsky","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"}],"citation-key":"hajovskyCognitiveAssessmentEvaluation2021","event-place":"Weldon Spring, MO","event-title":"Missouri Association of School Psychologists 2021 Fall Conference","genre":"Webinar","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,24]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher-place":"Weldon Spring, MO","title":"Cognitive assessment in the evaluation of specific learning disabilities","type":"speech","URL":"https://maosp.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/Fall%20Conference.pdf"},

  {"id":"schneiderAssessmentsThatRestore2023","abstract":"Assessments not only prepare the way for better interventions, but they can also become potent interventions in their own right (Poston & Hanson, 2010). Instead of waiting until the end of the assessment to begin intervening, the entire assessment process can be made intentionally therapeutic from the start (Finn, 2020; Fischer, 1994). This approach does not require superhuman effort. Transformative assessments are possible when we apply—wherever possible—the same empathic consideration to examinees as we would in a counseling setting. Although this idea sounds simple, there are many aspects of assessment (e.g., report writing) where its application is not at all obvious. In this workshop, we will learn a set of principles designed to help the examinee and others see the presenting problem with new eyes and thus inspire effective efforts to make necessary changes. \n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nAs a result of this session, attendees will be able to:\n\nList the principles of collaborative and therapeutic assessment.\nApply a report writing style that recasts the assessment report as a means of communicating an empathic understanding of an examinee.\nIdentify common writing habits that pose unnecessary barriers to comprehension.\nUtilize assessment feedback into the overall intervention plan.","author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"}],"citation-key":"schneiderAssessmentsThatRestore2023","event-place":"Philadelphia, PA","event-title":"42nd Annual School Psychology, Counseling Psychology and Applied Behavior Analysis Conference","genre":"Invited Lecture","issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,24]]},"publisher-place":"Philadelphia, PA","title":"Assessments that restore hope, promote understanding and inspire change","type":"speech","URL":"https://education.temple.edu/node/50031"},
