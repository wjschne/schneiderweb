  {"id":"hajovskyCognitiveAssessmentEvaluation2021","abstract":"Cognitive ability tests are often included in diagnostic psychological assessments in school settings for the evaluation of\nspecific learning disabilities (Benson et al., 2019). This session will involve a discussion of recent developments of the theory\nand practice of cognitive assessment, and the interpretative flexibility afforded by different instruments. We demonstrate the\nvalue-added benefit of using cognitive assessment judiciously to make valid decisions to inform placement and treatment. Learning Objectives:\n1. Participants will understand recent developments in CHC theory and how it applies to assessment and interpretation\n2. Participants will learn about the interpretative flexibility afforded by the three most popular IQ tests (WISC-V, KABCII NU, WJ IV)\n3. Participants will examine how cognitive assessment results can clarify identification and treatment outcomes using a\ncase example","author":[{"family":"Hajovsky","given":"Daniel B."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"}],"event":"Missouri Association of School Psychologists 2021 Fall Conference","event-place":"Weldon Spring, MO","genre":"Webinar","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,24]]},"publisher-place":"Weldon Spring, MO","title":"Cognitive assessment in the evaluation of specific learning disabilities","type":"speech","URL":"https://maosp.wildapricot.org/resources/Documents/Fall%20Conference.pdf"},
