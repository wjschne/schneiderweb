  {"id":"cohenPsychologicalTestingAssessment2022","abstract":"\"Psychological tests and other tools of assessment may differ with respect to a number of variables, such as content, format, administration procedures, scoring and interpretation procedures, and technical quality. The content (subject matter) of the test will, of course, vary with the focus of the particular test.

With a focus on current practice, this new second edition covers DSM-5 updates and the latest assessment instruments including the WJ IV, WISC-V, WAIS-IV, KTEA-3, and the CAS2.
