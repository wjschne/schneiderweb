  {"id":"nichollsNeuropsychologicalProfilesTwins2016","abstract":"Objective\n\nSotos syndrome is a genetic syndrome that has neuroimaging anomalies including large ventricles, increased extracerebral fluid, and midline abnormalities.1 Other findings implicate hypoperfusion of frontal brain areas.2 The current report compares the neuropsychological profiles of fraternal twins discordant for Sotos syndrome.\n\nMethod\n\nA neuropsychological evaluation of the 7-year-old, second grade, affected proband (twin A) was compared with a similar evaluation performed upon his brother (twin B).\n\nResults\n\nTwin A’s (Sotos) neuropsychological profile was characterized by impaired spatial reasoning and working memory, as compared with relatively more preserved verbal and nonverbal reasoning skills. Performance on overlearned and concrete information was superior to novel conceptual learning and global (as opposed to local) information processing. Mathematics problem solving was more impaired than early reading skills. Frontal/executive functions were significantly impaired. Adaptive behavioral skill development was less impaired, falling in the low average range overall. Comparison of twins A and B documented significant differences in all areas except fine motor speed, with largest differences observed in dorsal stream visuospatial/constructional functions and working memory. Social perception and complex fine motor coordination were impaired in proband but not brother.\n\nDiscussion/Conclusion\n\nThe current findings are consistent with previous reports that Sotos syndrome may present with evidence of a mixed right hemisphere learning disability and a profile of executive function impairments. These findings point to the necessity of evaluating individuals with Sotos syndrome at a neuropsychological level, as reliance upon more global intelligence test scores inadequately describes their abilities.","author":[{"family":"Nicholls","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Ross","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"William Joel"}],"citation-key":"nichollsNeuropsychologicalProfilesTwins2016","event-place":"Las Vegas, NV","event-title":"American Academy of Pediatric Neuropsychology Annual Conference","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,15]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher-place":"Las Vegas, NV","title":"The neuropsychological profiles of twins discordant for Sotos Syndrome: A case study","type":"speech"},
