```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Sometimes I want to put a plot caption in the lower right corner of the plot.

```{r}
p <- ggplot() +
  stat_function(xlim = c(-4,4), fun = dnorm) + 
  labs(x = "z-scores", caption = "Note: Mean = 0, SD = 1")

p
```

However, I want the caption to be a little higher, on the same line as the x-axis title. To do so, set a a negative top margin:

```{r}
p + theme(plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, unit = "pt")))
```
