I am an associate professor at [Temple University in the College of Education and Human Development](https://education.temple.edu/). I belong to both the [School Psychology](https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/school-psychology-phd-ed-scps-phd) and [Educational Leadership](https://www.temple.edu/academics/degree-programs/educational-leadership-edd-ed-edls-edd) programs. 

Although I have diverse interests, my primary focus is trying to understand and improve the validity of psychological assessment practices. I [teach courses](/courses) in assessment, counseling, statistics, and research methods.

I grew up in Southern California (1970--1990) and lived in C&oacute;rdoba, Argentina (1990--1992). I completed my undergraduate degree in [Psychology at the University of California at Berkeley](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/) in 1995 and my doctoral studies in [clinical psychology at Texas A&M University](https://liberalarts.tamu.edu/psychology/phd/clinical/) in 2003. My internship year (2001--2002) was spent in the [Dutchess County Department of Behavioral & Community Health](https://www.dutchessny.gov/Departments/DBCH/dbch.htm) in Poughkeepsie, NY. Since then I have been faculty member at [Illinois State University](https://psychology.illinoisstate.edu/) (2002--2017) and [Temple University](https://education.temple.edu/) (2017--Present).
