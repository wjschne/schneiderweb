A function for retrieving a div or span from another markdown document

<!--more-->

While assembling a reply letter for a revise-and-resubmit document, I was documenting for reviewers how we addressed their concerns. The reply letter quoted numerous sentences and paragraphs that had been changed. Unfortunately, each time my co-authors and I edited the paper, I lost track of which sentences and paragraphs I had previously copied into the reply letter. I did not want to misquote my own paper.

Copying-and-pasting with each edit was getting tedious and it was an error-prone process. I decided to write a simple function that would retrieve a named div or span from the paper and print it as a quote in my reply letter. Here it is:

```{r}
get_quote <- function(id, file, blockquote = TRUE) {

  # Insert blockquote text
  if (blockquote) {
    blockchr <- "\n> "
    } else {
    blockchr <- ""
  }

  #read in lines from file
  filetext <- readLines(file, warn = FALSE)

  # collapse lines and search for span with id
  s <- filetext |>
    paste0(collapse = "\n") |>
    stringr::str_match(
      pattern = paste0(
        "(?<=\\[).+(?=\\]\\{\\#",
        id,
        "\\})"))  |>
    getElement(1)

  # If no span found, search for div with id
  if (is.na(s)) {
    s <- filetext |>
      paste0(collapse = "|||") |>
      stringr::str_match(
        pattern = paste0(
          ":::\\{\\#",
          id,
          "\\}(.*?):::"))  |>
      getElement(2) |>
      stringr::str_replace_all("\\|\\|\\|", blockchr)
  } else {
    s <- paste0(blockchr, s)
  }

  if (is.na(s)) stop("Could not find id = ", id)
  s
}

```

For your convenience and mine, I have added this function into the [WJSmisc package](https://wjschne.github.io/WJSmisc/).

# Using the `get_quote` function

If the file has a span or div with a specified id, the `get_quote` function can find it. Suppose the file has a span with id of `id1` and a div with id of `id2`.

```
[Text in a span]{#id1}

:::{#id2}
Here are two pagagraphs in a fenced div.

This is the second paragraph.
:::
```

You can pull text from the current file or another file. This file happened to be named `index.Rmd`. The text inside the span with id "#id1" can be extracted with inline chunks like so:

```{verbatim}
`r get_quote("id1", "index.Rmd")`
```

`r get_quote("id1", "index.Rmd")`

Here we extract the two paragraphs in div id2

```{verbatim}
`r get_quote("id2", "index.Rmd")`
```

`r get_quote("id2", "index.Rmd")`

## Remove blockquote formatting

You can turn off the blockquote formatting like so:

```{verbatim}
`r get_quote("id1", "index.Rmd", blockquote = FALSE)`
```

`r get_quote("id1", "index.Rmd", blockquote = FALSE)`

## Curly braces with additional information

What if you need to put additional information in the curly braces of the span or div (e.g., a css class)?

```{verbatim}
[Here is more text with extra stuff in the curly braces.]{#id3 .myclass}
```

You can trick the function into thinking that the extra stuff is part of the id like so:

```{verbatim}
`r get_quote("id3 .myclass", "index.Rmd")`
```


`r get_quote("id3 .myclass", "index.Rmd")`
