<p>A function for retrieving a div or span from another markdown document</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While assembling a reply letter for a revise-and-resubmit document, I was documenting for reviewers how we addressed their concerns. The reply letter quoted numerous sentences and paragraphs that had been changed. Unfortunately, each time my co-authors and I edited the paper, I lost track of which sentences and paragraphs I had previously copied into the reply letter. I did not want to misquote my own paper.</p>
<p>Copying-and-pasting with each edit was getting tedious, and it was an error-prone process. I decided to write a simple function that would retrieve a named div or span from the paper and print it as a quote in my reply letter. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>get_quote &lt;- function(id, file, blockquote = TRUE) {

  # Insert blockquote text
  if (blockquote) {
    blockchr &lt;- &quot;\n&gt; &quot;
    } else {
    blockchr &lt;- &quot;&quot;
  }

  #read in lines from file
  filetext &lt;- readLines(file, warn = FALSE)

  # collapse lines and search for span with id
  s &lt;- filetext |&gt;
    paste0(collapse = &quot;\n&quot;) |&gt;
    stringr::str_match(
      pattern = paste0(
        &quot;(?&lt;=\\[).+(?=\\]\\{\\#&quot;,
        id,
        &quot;\\})&quot;))  |&gt;
    getElement(1)

  # If no span found, search for div with id
  if (is.na(s)) {
    s &lt;- filetext |&gt;
      paste0(collapse = &quot;|||&quot;) |&gt;
      stringr::str_match(
        pattern = paste0(
          &quot;:::\\{\\#&quot;,
          id,
          &quot;\\}(.*?):::&quot;))  |&gt;
      getElement(2) |&gt;
      stringr::str_replace_all(&quot;\\|\\|\\|&quot;, blockchr)
  } else {
    s &lt;- paste0(blockchr, s)
  }

  if (is.na(s)) stop(&quot;Could not find id = &quot;, id)
  s
}</code></pre>
<p>For your convenience and mine, I have added this function into the <a href="https://wjschne.github.io/WJSmisc/">WJSmisc package</a>.</p>
<div id="using-the-get_quote-function" class="section level1">
<h1>Using the <code>get_quote</code> function</h1>
<p>If the file has a span or div with a specified id, the <code>get_quote</code> function can find it. Suppose the file has a span with id of <code>id1</code> and a div with id of <code>id2</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[Text in a span]{#id1}

:::{#id2}
Here are two pagagraphs in a fenced div.

This is the second paragraph.
:::

cat(get_quote(&quot;id2&quot;, &quot;index.Rmd&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>You can pull text from the current file or another file. This file happened to be named <code>index.Rmd</code>. The text inside the span with id “#id1” can be extracted with inline chunks like so:</p>
<pre class="default"><code>`r get_quote(&quot;id1&quot;, &quot;index.Rmd&quot;)`</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Text in a span</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we extract the two paragraphs in div id2</p>
<pre class="default"><code>`r get_quote(&quot;id2&quot;, &quot;index.Rmd&quot;)`</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are two pagagraphs in a fenced div.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
</blockquote>
<div id="remove-blockquote-formatting" class="section level2">
<h2>Remove blockquote formatting</h2>
<p>By default, the function adds a <code>&gt;</code> before each line in the quoted markdown so that it appears as a block quote. You can turn off the block quote formatting like so:</p>
<pre class="default"><code>`r get_quote(&quot;id1&quot;, &quot;index.Rmd&quot;, blockquote = FALSE)`</code></pre>
<p>Text in a span</p>
</div>
<div id="curly-braces-with-additional-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Curly braces with additional information</h2>
<p>What if you need to put additional information in the curly braces of the span or div (e.g., a css class)?</p>
<pre class="default"><code>[Here is more text with extra stuff in the curly braces.]{#id3 .myclass}</code></pre>
<p>You can trick the function into thinking that the extra stuff is part of the id like so:</p>
<pre class="default"><code>`r get_quote(&quot;id3 .myclass&quot;, &quot;index.Rmd&quot;)`</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is more text with extra stuff in the curly braces.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
